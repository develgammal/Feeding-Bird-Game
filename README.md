### Welcome to "Feeding Bird"!

Inspired by the classic "Whack-a-Mole" game &#x1F528;, this is a more animal-friendly version where instead of smashing them with a hammer, you are a nice bird that feeds the critters instead &#128057;.

<br/>

This minimalistic game, built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, includes all the beloved arcade features: progressive difficulty levels, win/lose conditions, scoring, sound effects, and bonuses. It's a nostalgic nod to the games of our childhood &#128512;. The project was a blast to create using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîall in a single script file, with no frameworks involved!

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of logic and scope dependencies in JavaScript. I tackled problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces, focusing on one line or function at a time &#x1F5DD;. I also explored the use of `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setInterval` for performance-critical code, which was a key learning moment for me üí°.

Most of the artwork was generously provided by the talented [Alice Brereton](https://www.pickledalice.com/) for use in the Frontendmasters workshop. I edited the remaining visuals using basic 3D paint software, along with some open-source graphics "using my very terrible graphic design skills as a coding nerd".
