**Based on the childhood favorite "smash a mole" 	&#x1F528; this is a more animal friendly version where we feed them instead 	&#128057;:**

The minimal vanilla javascript & css game has all the common arcade features such as: progressive levels difficulty, win conditions, lose conditions, score, sounds, bonuses etc.. that made our childhood happy 	&#128512;, it was a lot of fun building this project using vanilla :icecream: HTML, CSS & JS " as a single script file this time instead of modules " without the aid of any framework.

what I learned the most in this project was appreciating logic & scope dependencies in JS and how to solve problems by breaking them into smaller chunks and dealing with them one line/function at a time &#x1F5DD; & how to employ requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval when dealing with hot code where real time performance could pose an issue which was a really important concept for me to tackle. ðŸ’¡

the rest of the visuals were edited by me using basic 3D paint editing software as well as some open source graphics sources that I found online.
