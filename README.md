based on the childhood favorite "smash a mole" 	&#x1F528; this is a more animal friendly version where we feed them instead 	&#128057;

It was a lot of fun building this project using vanilla HTML, CSS & JS without the aid of any framework

what I learned the most in this project was appreciating logic & scope dependencies in JS and how to solve problems by breaking them into smaller chunks and dealing with them one line/function at a time; &#x1F5DD;

& how to employ requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval when dealing with hot code where real time performance could pose an issue which was a really important concept for me to tackle 💡
