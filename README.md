**Based on the childhood favorite "smash a mole" 	&#x1F528; this is a more animal friendly version where we feed them instead 	&#128057;:**

The game has all the common arcade features such as: progressive levels difficulty, win conditions, lose conditions, score, sounds, bonuses etc.. that made our childhood happy 	&#128512;, it was a lot of fun building this project using vanilla :icecream: HTML, CSS & JS without the aid of any framework.

what I learned the most in this project was appreciating logic & scope dependencies in JS and how to solve problems by breaking them into smaller chunks and dealing with them one line/function at a time &#x1F5DD; & how to employ requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval when dealing with hot code where real time performance could pose an issue which was a really important concept for me to tackle. 💡
